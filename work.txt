RAS Tool Development for MI-Series GPUs (Feb 2023 – Aug 2024)

Developed a user-mode Linux RAS tool for AMD MI300/MI308 GPUs, enabling real-time error monitoring and injection for data center deployments.

Designed error injection and diagnostic mechanisms aligned with the ROCm stack, improving reliability testing in HPC environments.

Added gTest cases and adopted TDD, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code.

RAS Tool for SR-IOV & GIM Virtualization (Aug 2024 – Dec 2024)

Extended the RAS tool with SR-IOV and GIM features, enabling multi-tenant GPU virtualization in enterprise clusters.

Ensured compatibility with virtualized ROCm environments, improving scalability for cloud and HPC deployments.

Collaborated with firmware and kernel teams to integrate virtualization support across the ROCm ecosystem.

Unified RAS Tooling Across AMD Platforms (Jan 2025 – Jun 2025)

Led the unification of RAS tools across GPU families (MI300X, NAVI), standardizing reliability and monitoring.

Refactored the codebase for multi-architecture support, reducing maintenance overhead and improving platform consistency.

Aligned diagnostics and telemetry integration across firmware, driver, and ROCm components.

Python Automation & CI/CD Enablement (Ongoing)

Developed a Python wrapper for the RAS C/C++ toolchain, streamlining integration with automation workflows and packaging for the Python ecosystem.

Built CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Bash) to enable reproducible builds and faster system integration cycles.

Contributed to Agile design discussions, supporting system-level requirements and feature planning for next-gen GPUs.
